SOLVED BUG: thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: ErrorImpl { code: Message("missing field `by`"), line: 1, column: 83 }', src/libcore/result.rs:859
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace. -> item.by can be null?
    - These appeared to happen when there were some ghost items which appeared as ids but had no text or anything else in them. Might be because user removed it.

SOLVED(?) BUG: thread "'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: index < len', src/libcollections/vec.rs:768" which is caused when trying to expand comment over the index

    - might be a problem with index after rework (was correct cause)
SOLVED BUG: if no more comments and tries to next or back : next > No comments for 14810384 or all were dead (probably spam)
