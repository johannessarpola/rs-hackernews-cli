SOLVED BUG: thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: ErrorImpl { code: Message("missing field `by`"), line: 1, column: 83 }', src/libcore/result.rs:859
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace. -> item.by can be null?
    - These appeared to happen when there were some ghost items which appeared as ids but had no text or anything else in them. Might be because user removed it.

SOLVED BUG: There won't be any ui message printed when there are no comments for story or comment but the same comments get printed again.
SOLVED(?) BUG: thread "'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: index < len', src/libcollections/vec.rs:768" which is caused when trying to expand comment over the index
SOLVED BUG: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/14805523.json?print=pretty > expand 18 > No comments for 14805523 or all were dead (probably spam
    - might be a problem with index after rework (was correct cause)

BUG: Will cause panic if there are no internet.
BUG: if no more comments and tries to next or back : next > No comments for 14810384 or all were dead (probably spam) 
BUG: 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Io(Error { repr: Custom(Custom { kind: BrokenPipe, error: StringError("broken pipe") }) })'
- caused by chain comments x > next > back > top
