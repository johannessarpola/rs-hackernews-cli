SOLVED BUG: thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: ErrorImpl { code: Message("missing field `by`"), line: 1, column: 83 }', src/libcore/result.rs:859
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace. -> item.by can be null?
    - These appeared to happen when there were some ghost items which appeared as ids but had no text or anything else in them. Might be because user removed it.

SOLVED BUG: There won't be any ui message printed when there are no comments for story or comment but the same comments get printed again.
SOLVED(?) BUG: thread "'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: index < len', src/libcollections/vec.rs:768" which is caused when trying to expand comment over the index
BUG: Will cause panic if there are no internet.
