This has some listing for features that would be cool

- DONE(coming 0.3.0) Parse the comments so that there's some rudimentary formatting based on the html tags like <p>...</p>
- DONE(coming 0.3.0) Get links in comment with a separate comment and remove the duplication (<a href="link">link</a>)
- Show only 10 comments once like stories and use next/back with it
