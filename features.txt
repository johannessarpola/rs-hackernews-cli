This has some listing for features that would be cool

- DONE: Parse the comments so that there's some rudimentary formatting based on the html tags like <p>...</p>
- DONE: Get links in comment with a separate comment and remove the duplication (<a href="link">link</a>)
- DONE: Show only 10 comments once like stories and use next/back with it
- DONE: Limits to next and back with feedback to ui

0.3.1:

- Alter how many items are printed at once (10 now) from args
- Alter the width of terminal from args as well
- Make it possible to use themes from args
- Add shorthand commands like (e 1 and/or e1 = expand 1)
