This has some listing for features that would be cool

0.3.0:
- DONE: Parse the comments so that there's some rudimentary formatting based on the html tags like <p>...</p>
- DONE: Get links in comment with a separate comment and remove the duplication (<a href="link">link</a>)
- DONE: Show only 10 comments once like stories and use next/back with it
- DONE: Limits to next and back with feedback to ui

0.3.1:
- Format comments to max length so less automatic word-wrap happens
- Format preformatted (code snippets for example)
- Add option to print all comments rather than 10 with extra-args in cli::backend::UiCommand
- Add option to print comments without formatting with extra-args in cli::backend::UiCommand

0.4.0:
- Open nth link in comment with open when viewing comments (open {comment} {nth link (optional)}) (if not defined first)
- Alter how many items are printed at once (10 now) from args
-
