# CLI For HackerNews

This will be a cli (command-line interface) for HackerNews at some point.

Started this in regards to trying out several intersting crates for Rust and getting more familliar with them. 

I'm quite newbie with the usage of Rust so any feedback and contributions are welcome.

Not sure how far I'll take this project as the goal is just to be a learning experience and for fun.
